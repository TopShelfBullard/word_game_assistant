word_game_assistant
===================
<p>
  The word_game_assistant was my final project for my first programming course. The course was an
  eight week course before which I had not written a program, so what you see in my first commit is a
  good example of what I could create eight weeks after my very first "Hello world" program in my very
  first programming language. There are many problems with this program. Check out my blog about
  this project for info on the issues I encountered

  The program is immensely slow, the UI is crap, and there is no documentation. I plan to rewrite this
  program as a Ruby on Rails web app, because I am currently studying Ruby on Rails, and I see this
  as an opportunity to gain practical experience creating a large relational database and populating a
  view with data from that database based on input from the user. I also feel that, since the current
  program is so slow, it would be a wonderful way for me to personally see what sort of speed I can
  get out of the framework that all of the nay-sayers insist is so slow.

<p>
  Eventually I would like the word_game_assistant to be a program where you can enter your Scrabble
  letters and the letter that you would like to play off of and it will output every legal Scrabble word that
  you can play. Also,  with some slight modification, I see the user able to specify the length of a word
  in a crossword puzzle and the position of the letters that they know to get all possible matches from
  the database. Franky, I there could be many awesome uses for an application such as this, but for now
  I plan to keep it relatively simple.

  Throughout my work on this, I would love feedback from any kind Rails developers who happen to
  browse my code, and if anyone can suggest a great list of English words with which to populate my
  database, I would be in your debt.
