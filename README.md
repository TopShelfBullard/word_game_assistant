word_game_assistant
===================

Final Project: Programming Fundamentals
<p>
The word_game_assistant was my final project for my first programming course. The course was an eight week course
before which I had not written a program, so what you see in my first commit is a good example of what I could
create eight weeks after my very first "Hello world" program in my very first programming language. There are
many problems with this program. Check out my blog about this project for info on the issues I encountered

The program is extremely slow, the UI is crap, and there is no documentation. I plan work on these issue and
convert word_game_assistant turn this program into a Rails web app. Eventually I would like the word_game_assistant
to be a program where you can enter your Scrabble letters and the letter that you would like to play off of and it
will output every legal Scrabble word that you can play. Also,  with some slight modification, I see the user able
to specify the length of a word in a crossword puzzle and the position of the letters that they know to get all
possible matches from the database.
